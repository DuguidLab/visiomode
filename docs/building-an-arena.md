# Building an arena

This tutorial will take you through the process of building a basic arena for conducting touchscreen-based behavioural assays in freely moving mice. The arena will be built using a Raspberry Pi 4, a Hyperpixel 4.0 touchscreen, and a few other components. The total cost of the arena is roughly Â£500 at the time of writing, and can be built in a few hours assuming you have access to the required tools. The arena is designed to be as simple as possible to build, and can be easily modified to suit your needs.
