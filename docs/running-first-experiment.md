# Running your first experiment (with Visiomode)

!!! note
    This is a work in progress. Please check back later for updates!

Now that we've built our arena, we can start running experiments with Visiomode. This guide will walk you through the process of running your first experiment with Visiomode, from setting up the touchscreen module to running a simple behavioural task.

!!! note
    This guide follows the protocol found in our [protocols.io repository](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bumgnu3w), which we described in [Eleftheriou et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2022.109779). Here we will consider only the touchscreen-reward association task; you can refer to the [protocols.io repository](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bumgnu3w) for the full protocol, which extends to nose-poke and forelimb-reaching visual discrimination tasks.
