Visiomode is an open-source platform for rodent touchscreen-based visuomotor tasks. It has been designed to promote the use of touchscreens as an accessible option for implementing a variety of visual task paradigms, with low-cost and ease-of-use as a priority. Visiomode is implemented on the popular Raspberry Pi computer, and provides the user with an intuitive web interface to design and manage experiments. It can be deployed as a stand-alone cognitive testing solution in both freely-moving and head-restrained environments.
